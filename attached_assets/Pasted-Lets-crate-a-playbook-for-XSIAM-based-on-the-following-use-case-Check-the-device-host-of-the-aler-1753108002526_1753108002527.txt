Lets crate a playbook for XSIAM  based on the following use case:

Check the device/host of the alert’s privilege/access to protected data a. If it is a low classification device, we really do not care about suspicious VPN  activity since there is little risk 

An asset is priority if it is a member of the groups "3-Medium", "4-High Risk", "5-Research",  or "10-IT Infrastructure"

Reach out to the user via email or internal ticketing system 
a. Ask if they are travelling, knowingly using a VPN, or if the activity is not sanctioned 
3. Resolve as true positive if activity is not sanctioned, otherwise resolve as “Other”


Here are the initial alert context fields that we will use to develop the playbook:
