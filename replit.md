- **One-Click Ingestion**: Automatic threat context extraction and use case generation from feed items
- **Time-Based Intelligence**: Focus on recent, actionable threats rather than outdated reports

### Platform Status
- **Storage Communication Resolved**: Ingestion and display systems now fully synchronized with automatic cache invalidation
- **Workflow Pipeline Operational**: Purple workflow buttons successfully advance through complete security operations pipeline
- **Reliable Threat Ingestion**: Every threat ingestion guaranteed to save and display with proper workflow advancement
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Seamless transition from threat ingestion to security operations workflow
- User preference: Iterative refinement approach - test first, then refine based on feedback
- Clean, streamlined interface - remove redundant UI elements that don't support core workflow
- Avoid duplicate navigation - features should be accessible from one primary location
- Remove outdated UI elements that don't support the streamlined threat-to-lab workflow
- **Production Ready**: Complete end-to-end pipeline from threat intelligence to actionable security content
- Current status: System operating reliably for continuous threat processing and workflow advancement

## Key Components

### Threat Intelligence Processing
- **URL Scraper**: Extracts content from web-based threat reports using CORS proxy
- **PDF Parser**: Processes PDF threat reports using PDF.js library
- **Threat Feeds**: Integration points for Unit 42, CISA, Recorded Future, Wiz, and Datadog feeds
- **Content Extraction**: Automated use case generation from threat intelligence sources
- **Multi-Vendor Content Generation**: Automatically creates content compatible with hundreds of individual vendors and data source types

### Content-as-Code Generation
- **Detection Package Engine**: Complete XSIAM content packages (correlations, playbooks, layouts, dashboards)
- **Data Source Analysis**: Automatic identification of required data sources and field mappings
- **DDLC Framework**: NVISO Detection Development Life Cycle integration for systematic content development
- **Validation Workflow**: Manual review process for detection content quality and testing

### User Interface Components
- **Dashboard**: Central hub with content package tracking and quick actions
- **Threat Input**: Multi-tab interface for URL, PDF, and feed-based input
- **Content Package List**: Display and management of extracted detection packages
- **DDLC Workflow Modal**: Interactive Detection Development Life Cycle management interface
- **Content-as-Code Library**: GitHub-style repository for version-controlled XSIAM content with branch management

## Content-as-Code Data Flow

1. **Threat Intelligence Ingestion**: Users submit threat reports via URL, PDF upload, or threat feeds
2. **Data Source Analysis**: System identifies required data sources (Windows Events, Sysmon, AWS CloudTrail, etc.)
3. **Detection Package Generation**: Automated creation of complete XSIAM content packages including:
   - XQL correlation rules with proper field mappings
   - Automation playbooks for SOC response workflows
   - Alert layouts with contextual analyst decision support
   - Operational dashboards for threat monitoring
4. **DDLC Workflow Management**: Content progresses through NVISO Detection Development Life Cycle phases
5. **Version Control**: GitHub-style workflows with branch management, pull requests, and code reviews
6. **Production Deployment**: Validated content packages ready for XSIAM/Cortex Cloud deployment

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM, TypeScript)
- Vite build system with plugins for Replit integration
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL support (configured but not actively used)
- Neon Database serverless driver (configured for future use)

### UI and Styling
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom Cortex theme variables
- Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundation
- Lucide React for iconography
- Date-fns for date manipulation

### Data Processing
- PDF.js for client-side PDF parsing
- CORS proxy services for web scraping
- IndexedDB for browser-based persistence
- Zod for runtime type validation

### Development Tools
- TSX for TypeScript execution
- ESBuild for production bundling
- PostCSS with Autoprefixer
- Replit-specific development plugins

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Vite development server with HMR
- Replit integration with runtime error overlay
- TypeScript checking with incremental compilation

### Production Build
- Client assets built to `dist/public` using Vite
- Server bundle created with ESBuild targeting Node.js ESM
- Static file serving through Express.js middleware

### Database Strategy
- **Current**: IndexedDB for client-side storage with full offline capability
- **Future**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for server-side persistence when needed
- **Migration Path**: Export/import functionality for data portability

### Scalability Considerations
- Client-side architecture minimizes server resource requirements
- Data export functionality enables backup and migration
- Server endpoints prepared for future centralized features
- Modular component architecture supports feature expansion
