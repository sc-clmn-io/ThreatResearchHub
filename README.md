# ThreatResearchHub - Content Engineering Workflow Platform

## Overview

ThreatResearchHub is a comprehensive Content Engineering Workflow platform for XSIAM/Cortex Cloud that transforms threat intelligence into complete detection packages through systematic engineering processes. The platform features comprehensive lab buildout capabilities that create authentic environments where ALL data sources forward logs to Cortex XSIAM for centralized threat detection and validation. Following Detection-as-Code principles with NVISO DDLC framework, it enables validation of threat scenarios from reports, customer use cases, and threat feeds through complete lab deployment with comprehensive log aggregation in Cortex platform.

### Simplified Lab Build Automation & Reliable XSIAM Content (January 27, 2025)
The platform emphasizes two critical capabilities for practical threat validation:

#### 1. **Simplified Lab Build Automation** (10-minute deployment)
- **One-Click Infrastructure**: Automated deployment script (`simple-lab-deploy.sh`) for endpoint, cloud, network, and identity labs
- **Rapid XSIAM Integration**: 3-minute data source configuration with ALL logs forwarding to Cortex XSIAM
- **Quick Validation**: 2-minute environment verification ensuring complete log aggregation
- **Focus on Speed**: Streamlined deployment process removing complexity while maintaining comprehensive data collection

#### 2. **Reliable, Functional XSIAM Content Generation**
