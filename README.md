- **IOC Extraction**: IPs, domains, hashes, file paths with smart filtering
- **Threat Categorization**: Endpoint, network, cloud, identity, web, email

### ðŸ“ˆ Live Threat Intelligence
- **4x Daily Updates**: Fresh intelligence from CISA, Unit42, SANS ISC, MITRE
- **High/Critical Focus**: Filters out noise, focuses on actionable threats
- **Real-time Metrics**: Threat counts, severity distribution, trend analysis
- **Source Diversity**: Multiple threat intelligence providers

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Services

## Sample Content Package

The platform comes with pre-loaded sample data demonstrating a complete detection package:

**APT29 Cozy Bear Campaign Detection**
- **XQL Rule**: Advanced correlation with risk scoring and field mapping
- **Playbook**: Automated endpoint isolation and threat containment
- **Alert Layout**: Analyst decision support with enrichment queries
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with alerting thresholds
- **DDLC Status**: Development phase with validation notes

## Data Integrity & Authenticity

- **Real Threat Intelligence**: Live feeds from authoritative security sources
- **Production-Ready Content**: All generated content follows industry standards
- **Authentic Field Mappings**: Proper XSIAM dataset field references
- **Validation Workflows**: Quality assurance at every DDLC phase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database (optional, uses in-memory storage by default)

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### API Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5173/api/health

# Get content packages
curl http://localhost:5173/api/content/packages

# Get content statistics  
curl http://localhost:5173/api/content/statistics
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Load Threat Intelligence**: Import from PDF, URL, or live feeds
2. **Parse & Normalize**: Extract IOCs, MITRE techniques, threat actors
3. **Generate Content**: Create complete XSIAM detection packages
4. **DDLC Management**: Progress through development lifecycle phases
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validate content against XSIAM specifications
6. **Production Deployment**: Export validated content for XSIAM import

## Detection-as-Code Principles

- **Version Control**: Every content change is tracked and auditable
- **Collaborative Development**: Multi-contributor workflows with reviews
- **Automated Testing**: Validation pipelines for quality assurance
